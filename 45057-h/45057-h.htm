5</span>REMARKS.<br />
Ambrose Gwinett.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Hypercriticism</span> has presumed to find
fault with this drama, which a better taste has denominated
&ldquo;<i>the serious domestic historical</i>,&rdquo; because,
forsooth, it smacks of the Old Bailey!&mdash;and, when
justification has been pleaded by citing <i>George Barnwell</i>,
we have received the retort courteous, in the story of the
witling who affected to wear glasses because Pope was
near-sighted.&nbsp; But a much better plea may be urged than the
example of a bard so moderately gifted as Lillo!&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Ravens of Orleans,&rdquo; &ldquo;Dog of Montargis,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Family of Anglade,&rdquo; and numerous other public
favourites, speak daggers to such hypercriticism.&mdash;Ambrose
Gwinett is a strange tale and a true one; and a tale both strange
and true what playwright can afford to let slip through his
fingers?&nbsp; A murder or so may be prudently relinquished, for
the season will come round again; but he cannot expect to see a
man hanged and resuscitated for his especial accommodation every
day in the week.</p>
<p>Ambrose Gwinett favoured the world with his autobiography at a
period when autobiography was a rarity.&nbsp; He is
unquestionably the only historian who has written his life after
being gibbetted&mdash;drawn and quartered we leave to the
autobiographers and dramatists of another generation!&nbsp;
Egotism under such extraordinary circumstances may surely be
pardoned; and if honest Ambrose dwell somewhat complacently on
certain events of deep interest and wonder, he may plead a much
better excuse than our modern autobiographers, who invent much
and reveal little but a tedious catalogue of fictions and
vanities; a charge that applies not to the startling narrative of
the poor sweeper of the once insignificant village of
Charing.</p>
<p>The story, which occurred in the reign of Queen Anne, is
simple and well told.&nbsp; Ambrose had a tale to
tell&mdash;(what autobiographer would not be half hanged to be
entitled to tell a similar one?)&mdash;passing strange and
pitiful; therefore, like a skilful dramatist, who depends solely
on his plot, he affected no pomp of speech: of tropes and figures
he knew nothing; but he knew full well that he had been hanged
without a trope, and his figure brought to life again!</p>
<p><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>&ldquo;I
was born,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;of respectable parents in the
city of Canterbury, where my father dealt in slops.&nbsp; He had
but two children, a daughter and myself; and, having given me a
school education, at the age of sixteen he bound me apprentice to
Mr. George Roberts, an attorney in the same town, with whom I
stayed four years and three quarters, to his great content and my
own satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sister, having come to woman&rsquo;s estate, had now
been married something more than a twelvemonth to one Sawyer, a
seafaring man, who, having got considerable prizes, my father
also giving him 200<i>l.</i> with my sister, quitted his
profession, and set up a public-house near the place of his
nativity, which was Deal, in the county of Kent.&nbsp; I had
frequent invitations to pass a short time with them; and, in the
autumn of 1709, having obtained my master&rsquo;s consent for
that purpose, I left the city of Canterbury on foot, on Wednesday
morning, being the 17th day of September; but, through some
unavoidable delays on the road, the evening was considerably
advanced before I reached Deal; and so tired was I, being unused
to that way of travelling, that, had my life depended on it, I
could not have gone so far as my sister&rsquo;s that night.&nbsp;
At this time there were many of her majesty, Queen Anne&rsquo;s
ships lying in the harbour, the English being then at war with
the French and Spaniards; besides which, I found this was the day
for holding the yearly fair, so that the town was filled to that
degree, that not a bed was to be gotten for love nor money.&nbsp;
I went seeking a lodging from house to house to no purpose; till,
being quite spent, I returned to the public-house, where I had
first made inquiry, desiring leave to sit by their kitchen-fire
to rest myself till morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The publican and his wife where I put up happened,
unfortunately for me, to be acquainted with my brother and
sister; and finding by the discourse that I was a relation of
theirs, and going to visit them, the landlady presently said she
would endeavour to get me a bed; and, going out of the kitchen,
she quickly called me into a parlour that led from it.&nbsp; Here
I saw, sitting by the fire, a middle-aged man, in a nightgown and
cap, who was reckoning money at a table.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Uncle,&rsquo; said the woman, as soon as I entered,
&lsquo;this is a brother of our friend, Mrs. Sawyer; he cannot
get a bed anywhere, and is tired after his journey.&nbsp; You are
the only one that lies in this house alone: will you give him a
part of your&rsquo;s?&rsquo;&nbsp; To this the man answered, that
she knew he had been out of order,&mdash;that he was blooded that
day, <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>and
consequently a bedfellow could not be very agreeable.&nbsp;
&lsquo;However,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;rather than the young man
shall sit up, he is welcome to sleep with me.&rsquo;&nbsp; After
this, we sat some time together; when, having put his money in a
canvas bag into the pocket of his nightgown, he took the candle,
and I followed him up to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having occasion to visit the garden during the night, the
landlord lent him his pen-knife, that he might more easily open
the door, the latch being broken.&nbsp; From this knife a piece
of money falls, which Gwinett pockets.&nbsp; Returning to his
room, he finds, to his great surprize, that his companion is
absent.&nbsp; At six o&rsquo;clock he rises, dresses himself
hastily, and, impatient to see his sister (the reckoning being
paid overnight), lets himself out at the street door.</p>
<p>He has not been above an hour or two with his relations,
before three horsemen arrive, arrest him for robbery and murder,
and he is carried back to Deal, to be dealt with accordingly.</p>
<p>He is taken with the knife in his possession, tried,
condemned, and executed: yet, strange to say, the man yet lived;
his groans were heard from the gibbet, and he was rescued from
his frightful situation by his master&rsquo;s dairymaid.&nbsp; He
took ship, went abroad, and encountered Collins, the supposed
victim, who, it appeared, had been forced from his home by a
press-gang.&nbsp; After enduring many perils, he returned to his
native land, crippled and poor, and subsequently became sweeper
of the road at Charing Cross.</p>
<p>Mr. Jerrold has heightened the interest of his drama by
superadding the passions of love and jealousy.&nbsp; We have no
objection to fiction when it conduces to effect; and three rounds
of applause are sufficient to justify any interpolation.&nbsp;
This piece was well acted, and brought ample receipts to the
treasury of the Coburg.</p>

<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; Softly, master Collins, softly,&mdash;come,
there is life in you yet, man.</p>
<p><i>Col</i>.&nbsp; To be thrown from a horse after my
experience&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; Oh, the best man may be thrown, and the
best horse throw too; but come, you have no bones broken.&nbsp;
Had any man but myself, Ned Grayling, shoed your horse, I should
have said something had been amiss with his irons&mdash;but that
couldn&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p><i>Col</i>.&nbsp; No matter, I can now make my way homeward:
but, hark&rsquo;ye, not a word about this accident, not a
syllable, or I shall never be able to sit in a saddle again,
without first hearing a lecture from my wife and Lucy.</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; Lucy&mdash;aye, master Collins, she has a
tender heart I warrant&mdash;I could work at my forge all day in
the hottest June, so that Lucy would but smile, when&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Col</i>.&nbsp; There must be no more of this.&nbsp; You
know I have told you more than a hundred times that Lucy cannot
love you.</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; How do you know that?</p>
<p><i>Col</i>.&nbsp; She has said so, and do you suppose she
would speak any thing but truth?</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; Why, perhaps she would, and perhaps she
wouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I tell you, master Collins, my
heart&rsquo;s set upon the girl&mdash;if she refuse me&mdash;why
I know the end on&rsquo;t.&mdash;Ned Grayling, once the sober and
industrious smith, will become an outcast and a vagabond.</p>
<p><i>Col</i>.&nbsp; This is all folly&mdash;a stout able fellow
turning whimperer.</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; Stout, able,&mdash;yes, I was, and might be
so again; but thoughts will sometimes come across me, and I
feel&mdash;I tell you once more, master Collins, my heart is set
upon the girl.</p>
<p><i>Col</i>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll get the better of this, think
no more of her: nothing so easy.</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; There are some matters very, <i>very</i>
easy.&nbsp; It is easy for you, a man well in trade, with
children flourishing about you, and all the world looking with a
sunny face upon you&mdash;it is easy for you to say to a man like
me, <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>&ldquo;You are poor and friendless&mdash;you have placed
your affections on a being, to sweeten the bitterness of your
lot, to cheer and bless you on the road of life, yet she can
never be yours&mdash;think no more of her,&rdquo; this is
easy&mdash;&ldquo;nothing so easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Col</i>.&nbsp; Farewell, good fellow, I meant not to insult
or offend you.&nbsp; If you can obtain my niece&rsquo;s consent,
why, to prove that I love honesty, for its own sake, I&rsquo;ll
give you whatever help my means afford.&nbsp; If, however, the
girl refuses, strive to forget her.&nbsp; Believe me, there is
scarcely a more pitiable object than a man following with
spaniel-like humility, the woman who despises him.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">[<i>Exit</i> <span
class="GutSmall">L.</span></p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; Despises!&mdash;did she ever say,&mdash;no!
no! she couldn&rsquo;t, yet when I met her last, though she
uttered not a sound, her eyes looked hate&mdash;as they flashed
upon me, I felt humbled&mdash;a wretch! a very worm.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Enter</i> <span
class="smcap">Gilbert</span> <span
class="GutSmall">R.</span>&nbsp; (<i>singing</i>.)&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>A merry little plough Boy</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Gil</i>.&nbsp; Well, now master&rsquo;s gone out, I think I
have a little time to see my Jenny&mdash;master and mistress have
no compassion for us lovers&mdash;always work, work; they think
once a week is quite enough for lovers to see one another, and
unfortunately my fellow servant is in love as well as I am; and
being obliged to keep house, I could only get out once a
fortnight, if it wasn&rsquo;t for Lucy.</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; (<i>starting</i>.)&nbsp; Lucy! who said any
thing about Lucy?</p>
<p><i>Gil</i>.&nbsp; I did!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a good Christian
name, isn&rsquo;t it? and no treason in it.</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; No, no, but you startled me.</p>
<p><i>Gil</i>.&nbsp; I should like to know what right a man has
to be startled when I say Lucy&mdash;why one would think you were
married, and it was the name of your wife.</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; Lucy my wife, no, no.</p>
<p><i>Gil</i>.&nbsp; No, I should think not indeed.</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; And why should you think? but I&rsquo;m
wrong to be so passionate&mdash;think no more of it, good
Gilbert.</p>
<p><i>Gil</i>.&nbsp; A cool way of settling matters: you first
fly at a man like a dragon&mdash;make his heart jump like a
tennis ball&mdash;and then say, think nothing of it, good
Gilbert.</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; I confess I am very foolish.</p>
<p><i>Gil</i>.&nbsp; Oh, spare your confession: people will judge
for themselves.</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; (<i>aside</i>.)&nbsp; I am almost ashamed
to do it, yet I will.</p>
<p><i>Gil</i>.&nbsp; Why, what&rsquo;s the matter? you are
looking at <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>me as if, like a highwayman, you were considering which
pocket I carried my money in.</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; Pray, good Gilbert, tell me, do you know
whether Miss Lucy has any admirers?</p>
<p><i>Gil</i>.&nbsp; Admirers! to be sure she has.</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; She has!</p>
<p><i>Gil</i>.&nbsp; Hundreds&mdash;don&rsquo;t the whole town
admire her? don&rsquo;t all our customers say pretty things to
her? don&rsquo;t I admire her? and hav&rsquo;n&rsquo;t I seen you
looking at her?</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; Looking at her!&mdash;how?</p>
<p><i>Gil</i>.&nbsp; How, why like a dog that had once been well
kicked, and was afraid of being known a second time.</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; Villain! do you make mirth of my
sufferings? am I sport for fools? answer my question, or
I&rsquo;ll shake your soul out on the wind&mdash;tell
me&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Gil</i>.&nbsp; If the fox had never ventured where he had
no business, he&rsquo;d have kept his tail.</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; What mean you?</p>
<p><i>Gil</i>.&nbsp; If you had minded your own affairs,
you&rsquo;d not have lost your temper.</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; Answer&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Gil</i>.&nbsp; Not a word; if you are inclined to ask
questions, a little farther on there&rsquo;s a finger
post&mdash;when you have read one side, you know you can walk
round to the other.</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; I shall but make my agitation the more
apparent.&nbsp; Never till this moment did I feel the fulness of
my passion.&nbsp; Come, rouse man, stand no longer like a coward,
eying the game, but take the dice, and at one bold throw, decide
your fate.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">[<i>Exit</i> <span
class="GutSmall">L.</span></p>
<p><i>Gil</i>.&nbsp; Aye, it&rsquo;s all no use, master Grayling;
Lucy Fairlove is no match for you.&nbsp; No, no, if I mistake not
there&rsquo;s another, smoother faced young man has been asking
if any body&rsquo;s at home at the heart of Lucy&mdash;but
mum&mdash;I&rsquo;m sworn to secrecy,&mdash;and now for Jenny!

I thought you might have felt some qualms in taking that

<p><i>Label</i>.&nbsp; Ever had any patients, I&rsquo;ll whisper
a secret in your ear; I&rsquo;ve had one in this house!&nbsp; Now
what do you think of that?&nbsp; What follows now?</p>
<p><i>Gil</i>.&nbsp; What follows now? why the grave-digger,

of undertaker to that of doctor.</p>

<p><i>Gil</i>.&nbsp; Why! how nicely you could make one business
play into the other: when called in to a patient, as soon as you
had prescribed for him, you know, you might have begun to measure
him for his coffin.</p>
<p><i>Label</i>.&nbsp; Ah, you&rsquo;re a droll fellow, but we
won&rsquo;t quarrel; I dare say you think me very dull now, but
bless you I&rsquo;m not, when I&rsquo;m roused I can be devilish
droll&mdash;very witty indeed.</p>
<p><i>Gil</i>.&nbsp; Aye, your wit is, I suppose, like your
medicine&mdash;it must be well shaken before it&rsquo;s fit to be
administered; now how many of your jokes generally go to a

<p><i>Label</i>.&nbsp; No, no, it won&rsquo;t do, I&rsquo;m not

far the most desirable; but if you will go, why, a good night to
you, and a happy escape.</p>

<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; Her uncle&rsquo;s murderer, eh? are not
those the words? with all my heart, I would rather have the
deadly hate of Lucy Fairlove, than the softest pity of Lucy
Gwinett.&nbsp; Oh! I thought there was a world of mischief under
the smooth face of the assassin&mdash;had he struck for a deep
revenge I could have pardoned him, for it might have been my own
fate&mdash;but to murder a man for gold! for a few pieces of
shining dross&mdash;&rsquo;tis a crime to feel one touch of pity
for so base a miscreant.</p>

as the best.</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; Aye, it was but yesterday when the gay trim
master Ambrose scorned and contemned me! but yesterday, and Lucy
hung upon his arm! and to-day&mdash;ha! ha! ha!&mdash;I stood
against him at the fatal bar; as I passed, his brow blackened,
and his lips worked&mdash;his eyes shot the lightnings of hate
upon me&mdash;at that moment my heart beat with a wild delight,
and I smiled to see how the criminal shrunk as I told the tale
that damn&rsquo;d him&mdash;to see him recoil as though every
word I uttered fell like a withering fire upon his guilty

<h3>SCENE III.&mdash;<i>Inside of Prison</i>.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Enter</i> <span
class="smcap">Grayling</span>: <i>he has with him an iron
rod</i>.</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; So now for my task; this is a day of
triumph for me; I could have dressed myself as for a holyday;
this Gwinett once dead who knows how time may work upon Lucy;
perhaps I had rather the gang had seized and <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>torn the lad
away&mdash;but they deceived me&mdash;they took my money for the
service, and have never since shewn themselves; after all it may
be better as it is&mdash;Gwinett might have regained his
liberty&mdash;have returned&mdash;there&rsquo;s no marrying with
the dead&mdash;no, &rsquo;tis best&mdash;much the
best.&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Enter</i> <span
class="smcap">Bolt</span>, <i>the Gaoler</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="GutSmall">L.</span></p>
<p>A good-day to you, master Bolt.</p>
<p><i>Bolt</i>.&nbsp; A good-day&mdash;you are late, master
Grayling&mdash;you will have scarcely sufficient time to perform
your task.</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; Oh, plenty&mdash;I have an old set of
chains in hand; an hour&rsquo;s work will make them fit for any
body&mdash;so let me at once measure the prisoner.</p>
<p><i>Bolt</i>.&nbsp; The prisoner! do you not know that there
are two to suffer?</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; Two!</p>
<p><i>Bolt</i>.&nbsp; Aye; we have to day received an order that
&ldquo;mad George,&rdquo; as he is called, who was last Sessions
convicted for shooting an Exciseman, is to suffer with poor
Ambrose Gwinett.</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; Poor Ambrose Gwinett&mdash;you are mightily
compassionate, master Bolt.</p>
<p><i>Bolt</i>.&nbsp; Why, for the matter of that, if a
man&rsquo;s a gaoler, I see no reason why his heart should be of
a piece with the prison wall.</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; But is he not an assassin?&mdash;a midnight
murderer?</p>
<p><i>Bolt</i>.&nbsp; True; and yet I cannot but doubt&mdash;I do
not think a man with blood upon his head, could sleep so soundly
and smile so in his slumbers, as does master Gwinett; the whole
country feels for him.</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; Aye, it is the fashion now-a-days&mdash;let
a knave only rob an orchard, and he&rsquo;s whipped and cried at
for a villain&mdash;let him spill blood, and it&rsquo;s
marvellous the compassion that awaits him.</p>
<p><i>Bolt</i>.&nbsp; Why, how now, master Grayling? once you
would not have talked in this manner&mdash;you had one time a
heart as tender as a girl&rsquo;s&mdash;I have seen you drop a
tear upon the hand of a prisoner, as you have fitted the iron
upon it.&nbsp; Methinks you are strangely changed of late.</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; I am&mdash;no matter for that&mdash;let me
to my work, for time speeds on.</p>
<p><i>Bolt</i>.&nbsp; Well, you can first begin with mad
George.</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; And why not with Gwinett?&mdash;with
Gwinett, I say, the murderer?</p>
<p><i>Bolt</i>.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s engaged, at present, taking
leave of poor <a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>Lucy Fairlove; eh! why what&rsquo;s the matter with you?
why you start and shake as though it was you that was going to
suffer.</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; Well, well, delay no longer.</p>
<p><i>Bolt</i>.&nbsp; (<i>calls without</i>.)&nbsp; Holloa! Tom,
bring poor George hither.&nbsp; Poor fellow, he had begun to hope
for pardon just as the warrant came down.</p>

<p><i>Geo</i>.&nbsp; Now, what further, good master Bolt?</p>
<p><i>Bolt</i>.&nbsp; Why, there is another little
ceremony&mdash;you know the sentence is&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Geo</i>.&nbsp; Aye, I remember, to be placed as a scarecrow
to my brother smugglers,&mdash;well, no matter, they&rsquo;ll let
me, I hope, hang over the beach with the salt spray sometimes
dashing upon me, and the sea-gull screaming around.</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; Give me your hand, friend; so, (<i>shakes
hands</i>.) this is an ugly task of mine, but you bear no
malice?</p>
<p><i>Geo</i>.&nbsp; I never knew it when I was a free and happy
man, and should never feel it in my dying hour&mdash;and to prove
to you that the fear of death has not wasted my
powers,&mdash;there, bend that arm before you measure
it&mdash;stronger men than you, I take it, have tried in
vain.&mdash;(<i>Grayling takes hold of George&rsquo;s arm</i>,
<i>and with a slight effort</i>, <i>bends it</i>.)&nbsp; Ah!
there was but one man who could do this&mdash;he who did it when
a boy&mdash;surely you are not&mdash;yes, it
is&mdash;Grayling!</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; Eh! George&mdash;George Wildrove&mdash;my
earliest, my best of friends, (<i>they embrace</i>.)&nbsp; Oh!
and to meet you now, and in such a place&mdash;and I&mdash;the
wretch employed to&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Geo</i>.&nbsp; Nay, Grayling, this is weak&mdash;your task
is not a free one, &rsquo;tis, I know, imposed upon you&mdash;to
the work, and whilst you measure the limbs of mad George, the
felon, think not, for I would not think of him&mdash;think not of
George Wildrove, the school-boy.</p>

sleeves</i>, <i>and is about to measure the arm</i>, <i>when his
eye falls upon George&rsquo;s wrist</i>.&nbsp; <i>Grayling</i>,
<i>starting back with horror</i>.]</p>
<p>No, no, not if these prison walls were turned to gold, and I
by fulfilling this hateful task, might become the whole
possessor, I would not do it&mdash;as I have a soul, I would
not.</p>

now?</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; Your wrist, George.</p>

<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; Do you not see?</p>
<p><i>Geo</i>.&nbsp; What?</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; That scar&mdash;in that scar I read the
preservation of my life&mdash;alas! now worthless&mdash;can I
forget that the knife aimed at my heart, struck
there&mdash;there&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Geo</i>.&nbsp; Oh, a schoolboy frolic, go on, good Ned.</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; Never!&nbsp; Oh, George, I am a wretch, a
poor forlorn discarded wretch&mdash;the earth has lost its
sweetness to me&mdash;I am hopeless, aimless&mdash;I had thought
my heart was wholly changed to stone&mdash;I find there is
one&mdash;one pulse left, that beats with gratitude, with more
than early friendship.</p>
<p><i>Bolt</i>.&nbsp; Come, master Grayling, you know there is
another prisoner.</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; Ah! I had forgotten&mdash;gaoler, chains
for this man, to be made an Emperor, I could not forge&mdash;if
you will, say so to the governor: for the other prisoner,
I&rsquo;ll work&mdash;oh, how I&rsquo;ll toil&mdash;but come a
moment, George&mdash;let my heart give a short time to
friendship, &rsquo;ere again &rsquo;tis yielded up to hate.</p>

beneath the eye of heaven.&mdash;&ldquo;Good-day&rdquo; to a
wretch like me! it has a sound of mockery.</p>

so.</p>
<p><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span><i>Gwin</i>.&nbsp; I am sure you did not.&nbsp; It was
my own waywardness that misconstrued you&mdash;I am
sorry&mdash;pardon me, good man&mdash;and if you would yield a
favour to a hapless creature, now standing on the brink of the

<p><i>Bolt</i>.&nbsp; And why not there, master Ambrose?</p>
<p><i>Gwin</i>.&nbsp; Why not!&mdash;the cottage wherein I was
born looks out on the place&mdash;many a summer&rsquo;s day, when
a child, a little happy child, close by my mother&rsquo;s side,
my hand in her&rsquo;s, I have wandered there picking the wild
flowers springing up around us&mdash;oh! what a multitude of
recollections crowd upon me&mdash;that meadow!&mdash;many a
summer&rsquo;s night have I with my little sisters, sat waiting
my father&rsquo;s coming&mdash;and when he turned that hedge, to
see his eyes, how they kindled up, when the happy shout burst
from his children&rsquo;s lips&mdash;ah! his eyes are now fixed
closely on me&mdash;and that shout is ringing in my ears!</p>

name is mentioned, sigh and breathe a prayer for your
deliverance,&mdash;and some&mdash;</p>

desperate wretches, who&mdash;oh, would the hour were
come&mdash;I shall go mad&mdash;become a raving maniac: what a
life had my imagination pictured: blessed with thee Lucy, I had
hoped to travel onward, halting at the grave, an old grey headed
happy man, and now, the scaffold&mdash;the executioner&mdash;can
I think upon them, and not feel my heart grow palsied, my sinews
fall away, and my life&rsquo;s breath ebb&mdash;but no, I think,
and still I live to suffer.</p>
<p><i>Lucy</i>.&nbsp; There yet remains a hope&mdash;your judges

<p><i>Gwin</i>.&nbsp; Happiness&mdash;alas, no; my very dreams
are but a counterpart of my waking horrors.&mdash;Last night,
harassed, I threw me down to rest&mdash;a leaden slumber fell
upon me, and then I dreamt, Lucy, that thou and I had at the
altar sworn a lasting faith.</p>
<p><i>Lucy</i>.&nbsp; Did you so?&nbsp; Ambrose, did you
so?&mdash;Oh! &rsquo;tis a happy presage: the dream was sent from
heaven to bid you not despair.</p>

end.&nbsp; We were at the altar&rsquo;s foot, girt round by happy
friends, and thou smilest&mdash;oh, my heart beat quickly with
transporting joy, as with one hand clasping thine, I strove to
place the ring upon thy finger&mdash;it fell&mdash;and ringing on
the holy floor, shivered like glass into a thousand
atoms&mdash;astonished, I gazed a moment on the glittering <a

not to be found&mdash;the place had changed&mdash;the bridal
train had vanished, and in its stead, I saw surrounding
thousands, who, with upturned eyes, gazed like spectres on
me&mdash;I looked for the priest, and in his place stood glaring
at me with a savage joy, the executioner&mdash;I strove to burst
away&mdash;my arms were bound&mdash;I cast my eyes imploringly to
heaven&mdash;and there above me was the beam&mdash;the fatal
beam&mdash;I felt my spirit strangling in my throat, &rsquo;twas
but a moment&mdash;all was dark.</p>

<p><i>Gil</i>.&nbsp; I tell thee, Jenny, I can&rsquo;t help it;
ever as this day comes round, I&rsquo;m melancholy, spite of
reasoning.</p>
<p><i>Jenny</i>.&nbsp; Well, well; but it&rsquo;s so long
ago.</p>
<p><i>Gil</i>.&nbsp; But not the less to be remembered&mdash;it
is now eighteen years this very day, since poor Ambrose Gwinett
died the death of a murderer!&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure he was
innocent&mdash;I&rsquo;d lay my life on it.</p>
<p><i>Jenny</i>.&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s no occasion to be so
violent.</p>
<p><i>Gil</i>.&nbsp; I tell you I can&rsquo;t think with calmness
and speak on it.&nbsp; A fine open hearted youth, and see the end
of it.&nbsp; Not one of his accusers but is come to shame.&nbsp;
Look at Grayling&mdash;Ned Grayling the smith&mdash;don&rsquo;t
good folks shake the head, and the little children point at him
as he goes by&mdash;and then those two churls who scoffed at him,
as he was on the road to death&mdash;has either of them had a
good crop since?&mdash;havn&rsquo;t their cattle
died?&mdash;their haystacks took fire&mdash;with all kinds of
mischief falling on them?</p>
<p><i>Jenny</i>.&nbsp; Yes, and poor Lucy.</p>
<p><i>Gil</i>.&nbsp; And there again; Lucy, Gwinett&rsquo;s
widow, though almost broken hearted&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t she keep
a cheerful face, and look smilingly&mdash;whilst her
husband&rsquo;s accusers are ashamed to shew their heads&mdash;I
say again, I know he was innocent.&nbsp; I know the true
murderers will some day be brought to light.</p>
<p><i>Jenny</i>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure I hope they will; but in
the mean time, we musn&rsquo;t stand talking about it, or no one
will come to the Blake&rsquo;s Head.</p>

Jenny: I&rsquo;m not fit to attend to the customers.&nbsp; Ah!
good fortune <a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

seeing ourselves owners of this house; but I&rsquo;m sure
I&rsquo;d walk out of it with a light heart, if it&rsquo;s old
owner, poor Robert Collins, could but come back to take
possession of it&mdash;but that&rsquo;s impossible, so
we&rsquo;ll talk no more of it.</p>
<p><i>Jenny</i>.&nbsp; Well I declare this is all waste of
time&mdash;we&rsquo;ve the house full of customers, and here
we&rsquo;re standing talking as&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Gil</i>.&nbsp; You know we used to do Jenny, some eighteen
years ago; then I was waiter and ostler here, and you were dairy
maid at squire&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Jenny</i>.&nbsp; Well that&rsquo;s all past, where is the
use of looking back.</p>
<p><i>Gil</i>.&nbsp; A great deal: when a man gets to the top of
the hill by honest industry, I say he deserves to be taken by the
neck and hurled down again, if he&rsquo;s ashamed to turn about
and look at the lowly road along which he once travelled.</p>
<p><i>Jenny</i>.&nbsp; Well, I didn&rsquo;t mean that.</p>
<p><i>Gil</i>.&nbsp; No no, I know you meant no harm,
Jenny&mdash;but you will talk&mdash;well I shall go and take a
round.</p>

One-Tree-Farm to mope yourself to death.</p>

way&mdash;but I shall be back soon&mdash;eh! who&rsquo;s
this?</p>
<p><i>Jenny</i>.&nbsp; Why it&rsquo;s the servant of the rich old

<p><i>Label</i>.&nbsp; From India!&mdash;and as rich, and as
liberal as an emperor.</p>
<p><i>Gil</i>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve been some time in his service,
I suppose?</p>
<p><i>Label</i>.&nbsp; Some twelve years.</p>
<p><i>Gil</i>.&nbsp; Has he any friends in these parts?</p>
<p><i>Label</i>.&nbsp; He had when he left, or rather when he was
dragged from this country, some eighteen years ago.</p>
<p><i>Gil</i>.&nbsp; Dragged from the country!</p>
<p><i>Label</i>.&nbsp; Yes pressed&mdash;he was taken on board
ship at dead of night; the vessel weighed anchor at
daybreak&mdash;<a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>started for India&mdash;and there my master, what with
one and another piece of luck, got his discharge: but I believe
he wishes to see you.</p>
<p><i>Gil</i>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll attend him directly&mdash;and
then I&rsquo;ll go and take my melancholy round.</p>

<p><i>Label</i>.&nbsp; Nobody knows me&mdash;no one sees the
valet in the steward, the late Label, barber and doctor&mdash;and
only think that I should meet with Master Collins&mdash;a man who
was thought murdered&mdash;alive and flourishing in
India&mdash;poor Gwinett&mdash;poor Ambrose&mdash;I have never
had the courage to tell my master that sad story&mdash;he little
thinks that an innocent man has been hanged on his
account&mdash;somehow I wish I had told him&mdash;and yet what
would have been the use; he couldn&rsquo;t have brought the dead
man alive again, and it would only have made him miserable.&nbsp;
But now he can&rsquo;t long escape hearing the whole tale, and
then what will become of me&mdash;no matter; I must put a bright
face upon the business, and trust to chances.</p>

<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; That would have been the road
once&mdash;but &rsquo;tis many years since that was blocked
up.</p>
<p><i>Gwin</i>.&nbsp; I thought I could not be deceived.</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; You are no stranger then to the town?</p>
<p><i>Gwin</i>.&nbsp; No; it is my native place&mdash;that is, I
lived in it some years ago.&mdash;Have you been long here?</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; Ever since I was born.</p>
<p><i>Gwin</i>.&nbsp; And are doubtless well acquainted with the
history of most of its inhabitants.</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; Aye, history, yes, I have seen proud knaves
grovelling in the dust, and poor industry raised to wealth.</p>
<p><i>Gwin</i>.&nbsp; You, my friend, do not seem to have
belonged to the fortunate class.</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; No matter for that; but, Sir, take my word,
you had better not put up at the Blake&rsquo;s Head.</p>
<p><i>Gwin</i>.&nbsp; And why not?</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis full of company.&nbsp; The
judges are now in the town to try the prisoners.</p>
<p><i>Gwin</i>.&nbsp; Prisoners! you have, I trust, but few
convictions&mdash;<a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>at least, for very great offences&mdash;for murder now,
or&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; Murder!&mdash;no&mdash;&rsquo;tis now
eighteen years&mdash;eighteen years this very day
since&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Gwin</i>.&nbsp; (abstractedly.)&nbsp; Eighteen
years&mdash;it is&mdash;it is the day.</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; Oh you remember it then.</p>
<p><i>Gwin</i>.&nbsp; No, no; to your story.</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; I was about to say it was eighteen years
since the last execution for murder happened in these parts.</p>
<p><i>Gwin</i>.&nbsp; And the culprit&rsquo;s name was&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; (<i>fiercely</i>.)&nbsp;
Gwinett&mdash;Ambrose Gwinett&mdash;ha! ha!</p>
<p><i>Gwin</i>.&nbsp; Were there not, if I remember rightly, some
doubts of Gwinett&rsquo;s guilt?</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; Doubts!&mdash;There might have been among
those who are touched with a demure look; but no, he was
guilty&mdash;guilty of the murder&mdash;and I saw him die the
death of an assassin.</p>
<p><i>Gwin</i>.&nbsp; Pray was not part of his sentence by some
means evaded?</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; It was.</p>
<p><i>Gwin</i>.&nbsp; I have heard but a confused account of the
transaction.</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; (<i>eagerly</i>.)&nbsp; I can tell you the
whole&mdash;every word of it.&nbsp; He was sentenced to be hung
in chains&mdash;another that was to suffer with him, was
pardoned; so the murderer died alone.&nbsp; Never shall I forget
the morning.&mdash;Though eighteen years ago, it is now as fresh
in my memory as though it was the work of yesterday: I saw the
last convulsive struggle of the murderer&mdash;nay, I assisted in
rivetting the irons on the corse&mdash;&rsquo;twas hung at the
destined spot; but, when the morning came, the body was not
there.</p>
<p><i>Gwin</i>.&nbsp; Was no enquiry instituted?</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; Yes; it was supposed the relations of the
murderer had stolen the body to give it burial: the
murderer&rsquo;s uncle, and wife were examined&mdash;but after a
time, no further stir was made.&mdash;Curse upon the trick, it
cost me my bread.</p>
<p><i>Gwin</i>.&nbsp; How so?</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; Why I was the prison-smith&mdash;had the
irons fitted the corse, it must have been cut to pieces,
&rsquo;ere it could have been removed.</p>
<p><i>Gwin</i>.&nbsp; Gracious heavens! your name is&mdash;</p>

seen every earthly happiness snatched from me&mdash;I have sunk
little by little, from an honest industrious man, to the poor

suffer me to be your porter?</p>
<p><i>Gwin</i>.&nbsp; No! begone.</p>
<p><i>Gray</i>.&nbsp; Well, &rsquo;tis all one; yet you might, I
think, let a starving fellow creature earn a trifle.</p>
<p><i>Gwin</i>.&nbsp; Starving!</p>

I the will time would not let me; a few months&mdash;nay, weeks,
days&mdash;and the passenger may pause at the lifeless corse of
Grayling stretched in the highway.&nbsp; Every eye looks scorn
upon me&mdash;every hand shrinks at my touch&mdash;every
head&rsquo;s averted from me, as though a pestilence were in my
glance.&mdash;Intemperance and fierce passion have brought upon
me premature old age&mdash;my limbs are palsied, and my eyesight
fails.&mdash;What&rsquo;s this, alms&mdash;alms&mdash;won by

scene&mdash;the thronging multitude&mdash;the agonies of
death!&nbsp; The dreadful ordeal past, the ministers of justice
executed the remaining part of the sentence&mdash;the body was
suspended in chains.&nbsp; Whether it was from the inexperience
of the executioner, or the hurried manner in which the sad
tragedy was performed, I know not,&mdash;but your husband still
lived&mdash;the fresh airs of night blew upon him, and he
revived&mdash;revived and found himself hanging.&mdash;Oh! my
blood thickens as I think upon the torture that was
his&mdash;fortunately, the irons that supported him, hung loosely
about him; by a slight effort he freed his limbs, and dropping to
the earth, hastened with all speed, to another part of the coast,
took ship and quitted England.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
